# etch-n-sketch
This is my take on the etch-a-sketch exercise from the Odin Project. This demo is meant to reinforce DOM manipulation, so there is little work done through CSS. Key learnings from this exercise include adding and removing items from the DOM, event listening, chaining functions, and changing object attributes. I have also added some light animation, so I was able to learn about keyframes and the animate() method as well. 

This is not exactly what was suggested by TOP, but I am happy with the result. In hindsight this looks very easy but I did get stuck a few times. In total this took me about four hours to do.
